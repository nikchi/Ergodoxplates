# Ergodoxplates

## Rev 1 takes the usual format of a thick plate for the bottom, and and a thin plate for the top
181x181 4.5mm option from ponoko for the bottom
181x181 1.5mm option from ponoko for the top

## Rev 2 condenses it all because I was a dumb. It now all fits on a single sheet.
181x181 1.5mm acrylic from ponoko


Alternate top plates to make your Ergodox Infinity a floating key keyboard!
